## Some rudimentary analysis in Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button in RStudio,a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

You can also **knit** the document from the command line, see the example in the `makefile`.


### Summary statistics

```{r}
summary(dt)
```

### Plots

```{r}
hist(dt$polarity)
```

```{r}
# Overlaid histograms
ggplot(dt, aes(x=polarity, color=retweet)) +
  geom_histogram(fill="white", alpha=0.5, position="identity") + ggtitle('Some histogram')
```
